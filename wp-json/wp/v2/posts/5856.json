These security cameras are highly versatile and can be used for both indoor and outdoor surveillance, providing more unparalleled coverage with high data resolution for nearly any surroundings. Most modern dome cameras have a vandal-proof dome casing that can tackle extreme temperatures and harsh weather conditions, IR for auto night vision, and a robust metal base to protect it from any kind of tampering, making it an ideal solution for complete surveillance in rigid conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Major advantages of installing a dome security camera for surveillance-<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If cameras are deployed in surroundings that are highly susceptible to tampering and vandalism, it\u2019s always recommended by experts to choose vandal-proof dome cameras. Nowadays majorly every dome security camera comes with vandal-resistant markings to indicate the level of mechanical protection. Once these surveillance cameras are deployed, they get really difficult to be tampered with or destroyed with because of their complete robust enclosure which requires special tools and techniques to dismantle.<\/li><li>In addition to its sleek and classic design and the all-over versatile nature of dome security cameras, they don\u2019t even need any additional lens attachments, making it a reliable and integral solution for businesses or workplaces looking to provide wide coverage quickly and easily.<\/li><li>Due to constant development in technologies majorly all outdoor dome cameras are designed to be weatherproof, waterproof, and water-resistant so that surveillance goes on despite extreme weather conditions and tough environments. Dome camera manufacturers like Adiance provide an outdoor dome security system that is also equipped with temperature gauges and heaters so cameras can also operate in extremely cold temperatures.<\/li><li>Discrete positioning is also one of the key advantages of dome cameras because of the good encasing of dome cameras, it may get hard for burglars or intruders to determine even the approx. and accurate direction of the camera lens from a certain distance. This makes it difficult for any intruders to foresee the areas that are under surveillance without getting fairly close to the installed and mounted security camera itself, making it an effective deterrent for any crime and vandalism.<\/li><li>Many dome security cameras in modern times are equipped with auto night vision and infrared (IR) illuminators and motion and audio detection sensors within. This combination enables an unparalleled low-light camera performance for up to good ranges of 30 meters or even more, for both indoor and outdoor monitoring.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to the safety and security camera manufacturer of your premises, many options for CCTV Camera Manufacturers are now available in the market which is both affordable and reliable.
