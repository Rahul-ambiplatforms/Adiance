Several significant shifts have taken place in the use of technology and are even accelerating, for instance, the increase of multi-perception technologies, the convergence of security systems, the immense popularity of artificial intelligence, and the rise of smart cloud technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These changes are expanding and reshaping the potential of the security service industry, from keeping people and their assets safe to creating more secure, efficient, and intelligent surroundings for effortless thriving. Looking ahead at 2021, high hopes are there for transforming technologies and bringing them to the market, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adiance.com\/bullet-cctv-camera-manufacturer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">CCTV Camera Manufacturer<\/span><\/strong><\/a> gladly would like to share some encouraging and exciting ideas and thoughts here regarding the major key trends that may affect and benefit security industry in both the short-term and long-term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>AI video analytics leveraging deep learning and machine learning<\/strong>&#8211; Artificial intelligence is comprised of its two popular components, machine learning, and deep learning, which is already driving enhanced innovation by offering improved data and business intelligence to a greater extent. Technicians and software engineers have seen significant achievements in diversifying metadata, improving rapidness and accuracy, and increasing the granularity that would make surveillance systems capable enough to ensure better security and safety. Experts and researchers believe that in 2021 we may see wider and rapid adoption of Machine Learning technology integrated with new algorithms that would make surveillance and monitoring even more accurate while lowering the overall costs.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Beyond edge technology to increase speed and efficiency<\/strong>&#8211; Recent years have seen an immense increase in focus on edge-based solutions that decrease processing time drastically and are resource-efficient. But there still debates going on edge vs. Cloud vs. server have continued more than ever, as manufacturers seek to take maximum advantage of such platforms, they believe that in 2021, industrialists and technicians would see intelligent video security solutions deployed across edge, server, and Cloud technology, terming it a horizontal shift. Gathering information from various researches, they&#8217;ve explained that leveraging the benefits of these smart platforms would help <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adiance.com\/wireless-ip-cctv-camera-manufacturer-supplier\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">IP CCTV Camera Manufacturer<\/span><\/strong><\/a> offer more reliable and flexible video surveillance solutions. For instance, an edge-based video surveillance solution can provide instant alerts when detecting any uncertain motion and audio, and an operator who monitors can verify it through a cloud-based application to respond.<br><\/li><li><strong>Thermal cameras or low-contact solutions as COVID-19 fear continues<\/strong>&#8211; COVID-19 has prompted the more and more use of contactless thermal imaging solutions like facial recognition access control, surface temperature measurement, and mask detection alert. In modern video surveillance, the use of solutions such as license plate recognition is becoming more and more popular in the coming year as consumers look to eliminate physical contact risk. As contactless solutions continue to be a topic of discussion, AI-enabled security cameras can compliant with many of the processes which previously would&#8217;ve needed some access credential. For instance, license plate recognition for smart parking areas and traffic management can optimize space usage and streamline overall access.<br><\/li><li><strong>Smart Cloud technology as IoT makes more pace- <\/strong>Along with the horizontal process approach to deploying intelligent technological solutions mentioned above, experts also anticipate a whole renewed focus on smart cloud storage. Though it&#8217;s not a new technology to the security service industry, video storage in the Cloud is gaining more traction and immense popularity in both security and non-security markets. All this is driven mainly by growing possibilities in the smart cloud service and IoT space. Cloud technology and services offer varying opportunities for businesses of all sizes and industrial sectors, and its key advantages have only been visible by the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. Many organizations and businesses have found themselves reevaluating traditional and standard usage of existing technologies and security systems, while also seeking other measures to assist in day-to-day operations such as remote monitoring, live streaming, or providing additional coverage where less staff is required.<br><\/li><li><strong>Cybersecurity a primary concern for internet-based video surveillance- <\/strong>Cybersecurity has always been a concern for IP cameras and Wi-Fi security systems, but in 2020 this reached a new high because of the hacking activities increasing day by day. Early in this year, the FBI reported that it received about 3000-4000 cybersecurity complaints every day as soon as the pandemic began, in comparison to about 1000 per day before this pandemic situation. Since more and more smart devices are connected, CCTV camera hacking is no longer just about the mere security of recorded surveillance footage. In 2021, it is well expected that more consumers are prioritizing cyber-responsible security vendors and manufacturers who follow the best practices and meet all the required security standards. These vendors and manufacturers would also have to remain alert about the latest technologies and zero-day exploits and roll out patches as soon as any vulnerabilities are discovered.<br><\/li><li><strong>Enhanced acceptance for security surveillance along with privacy laws-<\/strong> In recent years we can see more and more countries and regions enforcing stricter privacy laws and protocols that control the use of video surveillance technology for any premises. This would prompt security service manufacturers and providers to take great care of the whole captured data, as they increasingly look forward to rising technologies for enhancing their video surveillance as a security tool that would help their clients and consumers to continue operations in a post-pandemic world. But there is also an increased awareness of the various advantages provided by the video surveillance system. With security cameras and the intelligent data provided by them, businesses and industries can now reopen and resume operations while ensuring their staff&#8217;s and visitors&#8217; safety and security. Video surveillance systems today can assist in enforcing face mask detection or temperature screening of individuals, as well as maintaining building occupancy and social distancing guidelines.<\/li><\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Camera Manufacturing, Despite a highly unusual and heartbreaking 2020, the security industry&#8217;s constant transformation and smart Surveillance Camera Manufacturing have not stopped.
