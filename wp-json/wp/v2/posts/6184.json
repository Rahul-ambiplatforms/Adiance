Whether it\u2019s home, commercial spaces or industries, these cameras are found pretty much everywhere we go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to start a CCTV manufacturing business, you have made a great choice. The CCTV camera market is expected to grow at 10.3% CAGR and reach 10490 Million USD by 2026. This is quite not a surprise as the need for surveillance is bound to increase in almost all parts of the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the opportunities it offers, CCTV manufacturing is a lucrative business. However, like any other industry, it also comes with complexities and challenges. This blog post will lay out five crucial things that you cannot afford to miss before you get started with CCTV manufacturing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also this Relevant Blog:- <\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adiance.com\/5-cctv-manufacturing-industry-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">5 CCTV Manufacturing Industry Trends You Need to Know<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. It\u2019s Not All About Capturing Video Anymore<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For most people, all cameras are the same. They all record the video and store the footage for later use. However, it\u2019s not the case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, the CCTV camera business has witnessed massive technological advancements. Not only there are many different types of cameras, but the latest technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud monitoring have also been integrated with these cameras.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, the first thing you should do is learn all about CCTV cameras and the latest technologies in the space. Without understanding the nuts and bolts of the industry, it\u2019s not possible to have a great CCTV manufacturing business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Different Types of CCTV Camera<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Which kind of CCTV camera do you want to manufacture? If you aren\u2019t sure about the answer to this question, you should probably learn about the different types of CCTV cameras used in the market. Let\u2019s see some of the most common types of CCTV cameras being used today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>PTZ Camera: <\/strong>PTZ is the short form of \u2018Pan, tilt, and zoom.\u2019 These cameras are highly sensitive, and they can detect the motion, sound, and change in heat signature and get activated. Thus, they can detect any potentially suspicious activity and warn human monitors.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>IR Camera:<\/strong>&nbsp;IR (Infrared) cameras are used for surveillance in darkness. Their infrared capabilities allow us to capture the perfect movement of things through Night Vision Cameras. They offer reliable, clear and sharp images in the nighttime.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>IP Cameras:<\/strong>&nbsp;IP (internet protocol) cameras, as the name suggests, are the cameras that are connected with mobile phones through a broadband internet connection. These are some of the most commonly used cameras in domestic and commercial spaces.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Facial Recognition Cameras: <\/strong>These cameras allow users to identify faces that are difficult to recognize within standard video surveillance technology. They offer remarkable accuracy of over 98.5% on public standard data sets.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>AI Cameras: <\/strong>As the name implies, these cameras come equipped with artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. They come with algorithms that detect unusual motions and offer high definition resolution. <strong><\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Other CCTV cameras include Thermal cameras, 4G\/5G cameras, Wi-Fi cameras and ANPR cameras.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. AI &amp; IoT are the Present and Future<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the biggest CCTV manufacturers invest a lot of money in researching and developing new-gen cameras. Although it\u2019s still the transition phase, we\u2019re witnessing a rapid shift in the CCTV camera industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conventional CCTV cameras need constant human monitoring to ensure the safety of a particular space. This becomes quite a challenge when you have hundreds of cameras to monitor. Moreover, humans can make mistakes, resulting in huge losses and accidents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI-powered cameras alleviate this problem as they facilitate machine-based surveillance. Plus, as a part of the internet of things (IoT) network, these cameras are now being synchronized with other devices to offer better security. For example, you can integrate AI cameras with an alarm system at your home to warn you of any suspicious activity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Complex CCTV Manufacturing Process<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of things go into manufacturing CCTV cameras. It\u2019s a ten-step process starting with circuit development till packaging. Let\u2019s see the steps involved in the CCTV manufacturing business:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Step 1: PCB development<\/li><li>Step 2: Raw material purchase<\/li><li>Step 3: PCB manufacturing<\/li><li>Step 4: SMT process<\/li><li>Step 5: IC Programming<\/li><li>Step 6: Assembling lens<\/li><li>Step 7: Focusing process<\/li><li>Step 8: Gluing process<\/li><li>Step 9: Quality inspection<\/li><li>Step 10: Packaging<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Industry Standards &amp; Compliance<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CCTV cameras deal with sensitive information, and that\u2019s why there are stringent standards that CCTV manufacturers must comply with. There are some country-specific standards, and some are applied worldwide. You must do in-depth research so that your manufacturing process follows all the guidelines and don\u2019t face any problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although CCTV manufacturing is a rewarding business, it involves a lot of complexities on the technical and business side. Thus, one of the most important things you need to do is hire good talents who have been in the industry for quite some time. Their experience and expertise will help you set your business on the right track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Top 5 Things to Know Before Starting CCTV Manufacturing CCTV manufacturing stands for \u2018closed-circuit television\u2019 and is popularly known as a video surveillance camera.
