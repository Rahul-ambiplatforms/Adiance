This tremendous growth could be attributed to increased government spending on such technologies and the eager adoption of thermal imaging in the healthcare and commercial sectors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason for the dynamic adoption is the recent Covid pandemic that drastically transformed the global thermal camera market.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we learn about the top 5 <strong>thermal camera manufacturers<\/strong> and suppliers in the USA, let\u2019s understand a bit about thermal cameras in general.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>What is a Thermal Camera?<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to a regular camera that makes use of light to form images, a thermal camera makes use of infrared radiation to create images. As a part of electromagnetic radiation, infrared energy includes gamma rays, little visible light, x-rays, radio waves, ultraviolet rays and microwaves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While all these forms of rays are related to each other, they differ in their wavelengths. Every object that you see emits some form of energy depending on its temperature. If the object\u2019s temperature is on a higher level, its infrared radiation is also more significant.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Benefits of Thermal Camera<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Thermal cameras are beneficial as the person handling the camera need not be physically near the person being evaluated. If you are the one evaluating, you can be in a completely different room as well.<\/li><li>Thermal cameras are nowadays predominantly used in measuring the skin temperature of persons.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Thermal body temperature cameras are beneficial during the pandemic as they measure the skin temperature quickly and accurately.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Top 5 Manufacturers and Suppliers of Thermal Cameras<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"555\" src=\"https:\/\/www.adiance.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Thermal-Camera-Manufacturers-1024x555.jpg\" alt=\"Thermal Camera Manufacturers\" class=\"wp-image-6068\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.adiance.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Thermal-Camera-Manufacturers-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.adiance.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Thermal-Camera-Manufacturers-300x163.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.adiance.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Thermal-Camera-Manufacturers-768x416.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.adiance.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Thermal-Camera-Manufacturers.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Several companies manufacture and supply thermal cameras in the USA, but most of them don\u2019t have the experience or the expertise to be considered a market leader.
