The analysis is based on different patterns and developments programmed in the system as Red Flags for a security breach.<\/li><li>AI technologies, such as face recognition, object detection, and intrusion identification, are certain patterns programmed in the AI software for video surveillance. These are extremely useful in terms of security.<\/li><li>For example, detection and raising the alarm for security threats like the movement of any object in a certain space late at night or entry of any human with a weapon can avert unpleasant incidents.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Are The Strengths Of Ai Technology-Based Video Surveillance?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"555\" src=\"https:\/\/www.adiance.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/How-AI-Technology-Makes-A-Strong-Video-Surveillance-System-2-1024x555.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.adiance.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/How-AI-Technology-Makes-A-Strong-Video-Surveillance-System-2-1024x555.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.adiance.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/How-AI-Technology-Makes-A-Strong-Video-Surveillance-System-2-300x163.png 300w, https:\/\/www.adiance.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/How-AI-Technology-Makes-A-Strong-Video-Surveillance-System-2-768x416.png 768w, https:\/\/www.adiance.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/How-AI-Technology-Makes-A-Strong-Video-Surveillance-System-2.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Real-time monitoring and threat detection for enhanced security<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>AI technology-based video surveillance cameras have revolutionized surveillance technology, as they can report anomalies within a second.<\/li><li>It\u2019s unlike a passive CCTV surveillance camera where you have to manually monitor the cameras for any developments or use video clips to get clues to detect and solve security concerns.<\/li><li>For places where footfall is huge, manual monitoring is an impossible task, so there are greater chances of a security breach. Therefore, airports, malls, college campuses, tourist spots, railway, and metro stations must be equipped with AI technology-based video surveillance cameras for a more secure environment and averting any mishap.<\/li><li>AI technology-based video surveillance cameras are known for their real-time monitoring and action. Even a small suspicious movement or development gets easily noticed by an AI technology-based video surveillance camera that immediately raises the alarm or sends signals for proactive action.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Effective intrusion detection through the capability to differentiate between animals and humans<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Installing an efficient security system is a rule of thumb for any building establishment. Real-time detection helps in faster response and action to safeguard things and individuals.<\/li><li>The motion detection cameras can raise the alarm when anything moves, be it animal, vehicle, or even shadow. So the chances of false alarms are very high. They are non-intelligent cameras. In comparison, AI technology-based video surveillance cameras are truly a smart option. It can be programmed to differentiate between animals and humans.<\/li><li>With AI technology-based video surveillance cameras, you can even plan the next level of security measures. For example, for abnormal movements detected in the no-entry zone of banks, government buildings, or hospitals, the AI technology-based video surveillance cameras can be configured to lock the doors of certain high-risk areas or vaults of bank<\/li><li>Also, in case of riots, if a violent mob or weapons are detected outside educational institutions, the AI technology-based video surveillance cameras can be programmed to automatically lock the doors to avoid any intrusion or bedlam inside.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Intelligent metal detection for preventing the smuggling of any weapon<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The long-used metal detectors and security scans are not 100 percent efficient. Even computer vision algorithms fail at times.<\/li><li>The traditional systems can only identify only those weapons and threats, which are fed into the system. In contrast, AI technology-based video surveillance cameras can detect harmful objects more precisely, even if hidden in layers.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Safeguarding against shoplifting for preventing losses<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In big shopping malls and retail outlets, passive cameras are not that efficient to check theft and shoplifting. So, you need technologically advanced security systems to curb this menace.<\/li><li>There are certain AI video analytics solutions specially designed to safeguard retailers from theft or property loss. This preventive mechanism can detect suspicious behaviors and raise alarms.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Quicker data extraction in case of emergencies<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>After any major outbreak of violence or terrorist activity, it is almost impossible for investigating officers to analyze video footage of hundreds of cameras installed in a particular area. So the data extraction is a humongous task for the whole team.<\/li><li>AI technology-based video surveillance cameras can help quicker data extraction making the investigation process easier and smoother.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Face recognition for tracing individuals for different purposes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The authorities now use face recognition to find or track individuals for various purposes. This feature of AI technology infused in video surveillance cameras has emerged as a less interfering and most adaptable form of biometric verification.<\/li><li>Face recognition feature, a category of biometric software, helps map an individual&#8217;s facial features. It stores the face print as data. The software compares a live captured image with the stored face print data to verify an individual&#8217;s identity through deep learning algorithms.<\/li><li>These were some of the strengths of AI technology-based video surveillance cameras that are making our day-to-day lives easier and better.<\/li><li>For more information, get in touch with Adiance Technologies &#8211; India\u2019s No.1 CCTV manufacturing company with expertise in AI technology-based video surveillance cameras.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Artificial Intelligence AI technology has made life easier in so many ways.
