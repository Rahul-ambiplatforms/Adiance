										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="555" src="https://www.adiance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CCTV-Surveillance-1024x555.jpg" alt="CCTV Surveillance" class="wp-image-6251" srcset="https://www.adiance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CCTV-Surveillance-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https://www.adiance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CCTV-Surveillance-300x163.jpg 300w, https://www.adiance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CCTV-Surveillance-768x416.jpg 768w, https://www.adiance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CCTV-Surveillance.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>To begin with, Conversational, ethical, quantum AI, AI in cybersecurity, and AI-Based <strong>CCTV Surveillance </strong>lead the way as businesses seek better ways to pivot, strategize, and adapt.&#8221;</p>



<p>The year 2020 was fraught with difficulties. Despite the disruptions, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an excellent opportunity for businesses to leverage technology. The industry has survived multiple digital touchpoints, from ensuring employee safety while working remotely to improving business functions.</p>



<p>As organizations continue to pivot and adopt new technologies, 2021 appears to be a year full of opportunities for technological trends.</p>



<p>The security industry cannot look forward to 2022 without first recognizing the significance of 2021: a year that changed every aspect of our daily lives, including how we socialize, work, communicate and collaborate.</p>



<p>Customers and technology enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating the latest and trending technology in the security and surveillance industry as the year 2021 begins. Extraordinary developments have revealed that advancements in intelligent video surveillance, artificial intelligence analytics, and cloud storage will have a significant impact on 2021 technology trends.</p>



<p>In today&#8217;s rapidly changing world, there is a growing awareness of the need for video security surveillance systems, which has resulted in the advancement of more security-related technologies. However, there are additional privacy concerns that must be addressed to provide safety and security to all citizens of a country and keep everyone safe. Several technologies have advanced dramatically to keep up with the fast-paced world.</p>



<p>Businesses in every industry re-evaluated every aspect of their operations as the world began to recover from an unprecedented global pandemic, from how they interact with customers to re-evaluating their marketing strategies.</p>



<p>This new environment has also resulted in new types of security challenges. Employees, customers, and partners are increasingly working from afar, sharing and collaborating via disparate online networks, which may expose data to theft.</p>



<p>Furthermore, as sites are monitored remotely, new public health and safety guidelines are governing how businesses operate.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an early look at these trends, as well as an assessment of how they will impact our industry in 2022: To help you succeed, we&#8217;ve compiled a list of the year&#8217;s top AI trends. This will assist you in remaining competitive in the AI era. Look at this:</p>



<ol><li><strong>AI edge computing/analytics: </strong>The prevalence of data and analytics is driving business decisions.In surveillance and security solutions, onboard analytics are increasingly being used to deliver data that can be used to drive intelligent protection and monitoring. As customers combine edge computing and AI to improve monitoring and search efficiency, onboard analytics will play an increasingly important role in 2022 and beyond.<br><br>According to one industry report, by 2028, the total global edge computing infrastructure will be worth billions of dollars. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge, particularly analytics based on deep learning algorithms, will be a critical component in a variety of &#8220;smart surveillance&#8221; applications.<br><br>These include object detecting, as well as the collection of attributes as metadata – all while lowering latency and system bandwidth requirements and allowing for real-time data gathering and situational monitoring.<br><br>AI and edge computing will continue to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of network video surveillance systems by using analytics to supervise any kind of area or situation (for example, object, loitering, virtual line, and area crossing detection). With AI and edge computing enabled by cameras used across vertical sectors, users can conduct &#8216;pre-emptive detection&#8217; and rely less on reactive monitoring, increasing safety and efficiency.</li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>AI Network is integrating vision-based surveillance systems.</strong><br>Video surveillance systems are evolving from basic monitoring devices to comprehensive solutions that can be used in any vertical industry or market sector.<br><br>The driving force behind this is the incorporation of AI technology at all levels of systems, a trend that is expected to accelerate at an unprecedented rate. Indeed, according to industry analysts, the global AI-based surveillance and security market will be worth $4.46 billion by 2023.<br><br>Artificial intelligence, with its two most popular components, machine learning, and deep learning, is already propelling innovation by improving data and business intelligence. We have made significant progress in diversifying metadata, improving accuracy, and increasing granularity, which will allow surveillance systems to provide better security.<br><br>AI vision solutions that use AI cameras as vision sensors generate meaningful business intelligence that can help organizations better understand their customers and operations. Thermal imaging and body temperature detection cameras installed at public entrances and lobby areas employ edge-based AI algorithms to avoid non-human heat sources and reduce false alarms.<br><br>People-counting algorithms are used in cloud-based solutions to assist store owners in evaluating sales or floor design strategies, as well as heat-mapping to measure and avoid long checkout lines to increase customer satisfaction. Traffic management and smart parking systems, logistics and distribution, and critical area monitoring in healthcare all have similar applications and benefits. Businesses can automate their security measures so that the appropriate response is pre-planned and ready to go.<br></li><li><strong>Business model rise</strong><br>&#8216;Video Surveillance as a Service,&#8217; &#8216;Access Control as a Service,&#8217; and other similar phrases are becoming more common in the security industry. What exactly does &#8220;as a service&#8221; mean, and what are the advantages that come with it?<br>As cloud-based services evolve and mature, video surveillance manufacturers can now offer &#8216;Solution as a Service.&#8217; Video surveillance system installers and integrators can now provide solutions to their customers through cloud-based platforms and then implement this model throughout all areas of their business.<br><br>The global market for public cloud application services is expected to reach billions of dollars by 2022. By combining applications, infrastructure, and business processes into a single &#8216;as a service,&#8217; or &#8216;aaS&#8217; offering, businesses can reap numerous benefits.<br><br>They can respond quickly to rapidly changing market conditions, bring new products and services to market more quickly, and maximize the benefits of advanced analytics to improve operations through meaningful insights – all of which contribute to a distinct competitive advantage.<br><br>Organizations can use these models to tailor solutions to their specific needs rather than relying on off-the-shelf offerings. A SaaS approach can provide scalability and cost-effectiveness by providing services through an operating expenditure framework, with services delivered via subscription, reducing capital expenditure.<br><br>&#8216;VSaaS&#8217; could provide cloud-based video surveillance by implementing SaaS concepts to video surveillance, eliminating the need for on-premises servers and allowing organizations to rapidly deploy systems without having to configure complex networks. Cameras and other devices can be monitored centrally, and many network and system processes can be automated.</li></ol>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>There is a greater emphasis on the responsible and ethical use of technology.</strong><br>As organizations have embraced digitization, the ability to manage operations remotely and gain better insight through the data generated by systems has provided greater value. It has been nothing short of transformative for many businesses.<br><br>However, as more of their operations move online, are managed remotely, and rely on the cloud, organizations must implement robust cybersecurity strategies to safeguard the data that has proven to be so valuable to them. According to Interpol, cyber-attacks have increased significantly during the pandemic, whether through phishing, online scams, and malware such as distributed denials of service (DDoS).<br><br>As a result, organizations are becoming more aware of their data protection responsibilities under measures such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and they are looking for suppliers and partners who not only understand surveillance-related data privacy rules but can also help ensure their data is kept secure at all times.<br><br>While the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is a US-based initiative, it is still important to many European businesses. Concerns about national security are spreading beyond the United States, and governments across Europe are hardening their stance.<br><br>As a result, manufacturers vying for certain types of contracts, particularly those in the government sector or involving international trade, will need to enforce compliance across their operations and product lines if they hope to win new business opportunities.</li></ol>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Technology integration is expected to continue.</strong><br>Network technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) are already widely used, but they will continue to disrupt the security camera market by enabling new advances in HD video streaming, including on mobile devices.<br><br>In an increasingly connected world, these technologies will broaden the potential applications for audio and video analytics and AI. On a broader scale, there is a massive increase in widespread digital transformation, with key technologies driving this change including IoT and networks, as well as cloud computing, intelligent data, and AI.<br><br>The Internet of Things is expected to benefit from advancements in network technology, particularly in terms of bandwidth and latency. Including advanced network technology in cameras allows for remote real-time video surveillance, expanded use of mobile applications, and legacy network management.<br><br>Artificial intelligence Internet of Things (IoT) can enable a nearly limitless range of potential opportunities, ranging from open and integrated systems/platforms to increased device connectivity.</li></ol>



<p><strong>F</strong><strong>inally</strong></p>



<p>In short, 2022 will see the continued development of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) to provide greater value to users, creating new business opportunities for installers and integrators. And, as AI is increasingly used at the edge – on camera – its benefits will reach a much broader audience, transforming the security market.</p>



<p>More businesses will use artificial intelligence in the near future as they become more reliant on AI systems. Given these trends, it is safe to say that AI is quickly becoming a critical function for all businesses.</p>

<p>Automatic Number Plate Recognition (Customized ANPR Cameras), introduced in the UK in the 1980s, has been a standard in traffic management. It is a high-speed image capture technology that identifies number plates as they pass through an infrared camera.</p>



<p>Initially, ANPR was used primarily by police officers to detect and thwart criminal activities. They allow police to monitor traffic and look out for suspect cars by placing cameras at highly suspected areas.</p>



<p>With time, the use of these cameras expanded to other areas, and today they&#8217;re installed in spaces like retail parks, supermarkets, private car parks, etc. Many car parks have ANPR parking systems that monitor how long a vehicle has been parked. They can also check if the parking fees were paid.</p>



<p>With the increasing demand for an efficient security surveillance system in many spaces, the market size for ANPR systems is expected to grow from USD 2.3 billion in 2020 to USD 3.8 billion by 2025, with a CAGR of 10% over the forecast period.</p>



<h2>What is ANPR Camera? How does it Work?</h2>



<p>ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) is a camera that uses optical character recognition and reads vehicle number plates when they approach. Here’s how it works:</p>



<ol><li>The ANPR camera takes an image of a vehicle number plate.</li><li>The image is passed on to a reader that converts number plates into standard Wiegand format ID numbers.</li><li>The number plate is compared with existing database records, and the access control system then analyzes this data to decide whether or not to grant access to the vehicle.</li><li>If the vehicle is to be granted access, the controller will send a signal to the gate/barrier to open.<br><br>ANPR is used to read license plates and identify cars, buses, trucks, and motorbikes. It’s also regarded as LPR or License Plate Reader.<br></li></ol>



<h2>5 Benefits of Customized ANPR Cameras</h2>



<p>The use of <strong><a href="https://www.adiance.com/anpr-camera/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">customized ANPR cameras</span></a></strong> has gone upwards throughout history, and that&#8217;s down to the numerous advantages they offer. Let&#8217;s see why ANPR cameras have become an important part of modern-day vehicle surveillance systems.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Completely Automated</strong><br>Although a security gate or barrier system can help deter crime and protect your property from intruders, it can also be time-consuming and manual. Vehicles will automatically be granted access to sites if there is an ANPR system. The system can match the vehicle&#8217;s number plate onto the main system. Fully automated ANPR camera system systems do not require employees to operate them.<br></li><li><strong>Better Security</strong><br>Automated customized ANPR systems work on the latest technologies and yield 99% accuracy in spotting unauthorized vehicles entering the premises. Thus, they unquestionably provide greater security and accuracy than manual checks, which are vulnerable to human errors.<br>ANPR systems provide you with peace of mind as they&#8217;re highly reliable at identifying safety issues, detecting a speeding driver, and helping to address them before a serious accident occurs.<br></li><li><strong>Time-Saving &amp; Efficient</strong><br>Automated ANPR systems manage access control and align with barriers and gates. This can help reduce time and improve management. The tracking of vehicle number plates can help you monitor employee clock-ins and clock-outs, eliminating the need for a dedicated person for the job.<br></li><li><strong>24/7 System</strong><br>As ANPR systems can operate 24 hours a day, they reduce or eliminate the need for security patrols and manned guarding. Moreover, it eases overall management.<br></li><li><strong>Real-Time Tracking</strong><br>ANPR is advantageous to numerous industries because of the real-time images it provides. In the past, number plate recording was time-consuming, and it took even more time to send out penalty notices to those who break traffic laws.<br>With ANPR, however, the number plates can be identified and checked against the database in a matter of minutes. Based on this, it can take less than 48 hours to issue a penalty notice. These cameras are fast and can respond quickly to crimes, thus ensuring that any undesirable behavior is not allowed to go unchecked.</li></ol>

<p style="font-size:15px"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Quicker Downloading and Uploading Speeds</strong>:</p>



<p>The 5G security cameras will enable you to upload the video camera footage to the Cloud or download high-resolution recorded video footage within seconds. This would be due to the power of 5G, which is set to offer top mobile internet speed of over 10 gigabits per second, which is up to 1000 times of the 4G network.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px"><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Smoother Streaming with Little Latency</strong>:</p>



<p>The 5G security cameras, backed by the power of 5G, would reduce the latency to a greater extent or digital response time. This means that the 5G security camera user would be able to view the Live footage of indoor and outdoor security cameras with almost zero lagging time.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Display Higher Resolution Videos</strong>:</p>



<p>Unlike the 3G network that fails to support 1080p full high definition (HD) video transmission, the 5G security cameras would be capable of streaming high-resolution video footage while ensuring the image quality and details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-size:15px"><strong>5. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Less Power Consumption + Longer Standby Time</strong>:</p>



<p>The 5G security camera systems, similar to 3G/4G security cameras, would be powered by batteries making them hassle-free. Due to faster speed and little latency, the 5G security camera systems would be able to operate much more efficiently while consuming less battery power and last longer in the standby mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-size:15px"> <strong>6.</strong>  <strong>High-Quality Two-Way Communication</strong>:</p>



<p>The 5G security camera will enable its users to enjoy high-quality two-way communication with an in-built speaker and microphone.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px"><strong>7.</strong>  <strong>More Smart &amp; Efficient Than Humans</strong>:</p>



<p>The 5G security cameras, when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools, would be quite useful in places of higher footfalls, where it may become difficult for security personnel to track every move. The 5G camera with AI and ML can also be programmed to detect suspicious movements via face recognition.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 style="font-size:18px">What Will Happen to 2G/3G/4G Security Cameras?</h2>



<p>Once the 5G is launched, it will dominate the security camera market. However, in the areas with no 5G connectivity, 4G LTE security cameras will still be used. And so, the manufacturers may still keep manufacturing the 4G based security cameras.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same may not be applicable for 2G/3G security cameras. As we discussed before, high-resolution videos (like 1080p Full HD) are not supported by 3G security cameras. Of course, the 2G cameras are way behind in technology compared to 3G.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, 2G/3G technology will not be compatible with 5G services, so manufacturers will certainly discontinue manufacturing or provide support.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 style="font-size:18px">What Does The Future of 5G Cellular Security Cameras Look Like?</h2>



<p>Undoubtedly, the 5G cellular security cameras will capture the security surveillance industry once the 5G is launched. However, the potential users of 5G cellular security cameras should be ready for the higher tariff of the 5G offered by the telecom providers.</p>



<p>As the equipment for the 5G network may be expensive to install, it may increase the operational cost of the network providers, leading to an expensive 5G cellular data plan that users will require for operating the 5G security cameras.</p>



<p>There can be other challenges for 5G wireless IP cameras. For instance, both the network provider and other related parties will have to set a global 5G standard before it becomes mainstream. Furthermore, 5G security cameras would be launched in the market only after testing them on the 5G network for actual efficiency.</p>



<p>All said and done, the excitement in the security surveillance industry for the adoption of 5G technology is very high. While the industry is ready for 5G CCTV camera manufacturing, the users are excited to upgrade their security systems with the latest and take full advantage of it.</p>



<p>All in all, the 5G technology is set to fuel the growth of the security surveillance industry as several industries like healthcare, retail, and logistics are eagerly looking to adopt the 5G security camera systems in their operations to achieve better security and efficiency. The 5G security camera systems are supposed to offer the advantage of multi-location remote surveillance, ML-based video analytics, and umpteen data storage in the cloud.</p>



<p>Although 5G security cameras will only be available after the 5G mobile network launch in a country, followed by the states, cities, and localities. Still, there are companies like Adiance Technologies that are well-equipped for 5G CCTV camera manufacturing in India.</p>



<p>Established in 2007, Adiance Technologies (ISO 9001:2008 certified) is one of the best companies for outdoor and indoor wireless security and surveillance cameras. The company’s product portfolio includes the latest CCTVs, including 4G Cloud Camera, Cloud Wi-Fi Camera, Smart City Camera, and 4k CCTV Camera.</p>
