However, there are additional privacy concerns that must be addressed to provide safety and security to all citizens of a country and keep everyone safe. Several technologies have advanced dramatically to keep up with the fast-paced world.</p>



<p>Businesses in every industry re-evaluated every aspect of their operations as the world began to recover from an unprecedented global pandemic, from how they interact with customers to re-evaluating their marketing strategies.</p>



<p>This new environment has also resulted in new types of security challenges. Employees, customers, and partners are increasingly working from afar, sharing and collaborating via disparate online networks, which may expose data to theft.</p>



<p>Furthermore, as sites are monitored remotely, new public health and safety guidelines are governing how businesses operate.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an early look at these trends, as well as an assessment of how they will impact our industry in 2022: To help you succeed, we&#8217;ve compiled a list of the year&#8217;s top AI trends. This will assist you in remaining competitive in the AI era. Look at this:</p>



<ol><li><strong>AI edge computing/analytics: </strong>The prevalence of data and analytics is driving business decisions.In surveillance and security solutions, onboard analytics are increasingly being used to deliver data that can be used to drive intelligent protection and monitoring. As customers combine edge computing and AI to improve monitoring and search efficiency, onboard analytics will play an increasingly important role in 2022 and beyond.<br><br>According to one industry report, by 2028, the total global edge computing infrastructure will be worth billions of dollars. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge, particularly analytics based on deep learning algorithms, will be a critical component in a variety of &#8220;smart surveillance&#8221; applications.<br><br>These include object detecting, as well as the collection of attributes as metadata – all while lowering latency and system bandwidth requirements and allowing for real-time data gathering and situational monitoring.<br><br>AI and edge computing will continue to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of network video surveillance systems by using analytics to supervise any kind of area or situation (for example, object, loitering, virtual line, and area crossing detection). With AI and edge computing enabled by cameras used across vertical sectors, users can conduct &#8216;pre-emptive detection&#8217; and rely less on reactive monitoring, increasing safety and efficiency.</li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>AI Network is integrating vision-based surveillance systems.</strong><br>Video surveillance systems are evolving from basic monitoring devices to comprehensive solutions that can be used in any vertical industry or market sector.<br><br>The driving force behind this is the incorporation of AI technology at all levels of systems, a trend that is expected to accelerate at an unprecedented rate. Indeed, according to industry analysts, the global AI-based surveillance and security market will be worth $4.46 billion by 2023.<br><br>Artificial intelligence, with its two most popular components, machine learning, and deep learning, is already propelling innovation by improving data and business intelligence. We have made significant progress in diversifying metadata, improving accuracy, and increasing granularity, which will allow surveillance systems to provide better security.<br><br>AI vision solutions that use AI cameras as vision sensors generate meaningful business intelligence that can help organizations better understand their customers and operations. Thermal imaging and body temperature detection cameras installed at public entrances and lobby areas employ edge-based AI algorithms to avoid non-human heat sources and reduce false alarms.<br><br>People-counting algorithms are used in cloud-based solutions to assist store owners in evaluating sales or floor design strategies, as well as heat-mapping to measure and avoid long checkout lines to increase customer satisfaction. Traffic management and smart parking systems, logistics and distribution, and critical area monitoring in healthcare all have similar applications and benefits. Businesses can automate their security measures so that the appropriate response is pre-planned and ready to go.<br></li><li><strong>Business model rise</strong><br>&#8216;Video Surveillance as a Service,&#8217; &#8216;Access Control as a Service,&#8217; and other similar phrases are becoming more common in the security industry. What exactly does &#8220;as a service&#8221; mean, and what are the advantages that come with it?<br>As cloud-based services evolve and mature, video surveillance manufacturers can now offer &#8216;Solution as a Service.&#8217; Video surveillance system installers and integrators can now provide solutions to their customers through cloud-based platforms and then implement this model throughout all areas of their business.<br><br>The global market for public cloud application services is expected to reach billions of dollars by 2022. By combining applications, infrastructure, and business processes into a single &#8216;as a service,&#8217; or &#8216;aaS&#8217; offering, businesses can reap numerous benefits.<br><br>They can respond quickly to rapidly changing market conditions, bring new products and services to market more quickly, and maximize the benefits of advanced analytics to improve operations through meaningful insights – all of which contribute to a distinct competitive advantage.<br><br>Organizations can use these models to tailor solutions to their specific needs rather than relying on off-the-shelf offerings. A SaaS approach can provide scalability and cost-effectiveness by providing services through an operating expenditure framework, with services delivered via subscription, reducing capital expenditure.<br><br>&#8216;VSaaS&#8217; could provide cloud-based video surveillance by implementing SaaS concepts to video surveillance, eliminating the need for on-premises servers and allowing organizations to rapidly deploy systems without having to configure complex networks. Cameras and other devices can be monitored centrally, and many network and system processes can be automated.</li></ol>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>There is a greater emphasis on the responsible and ethical use of technology.</strong><br>As organizations have embraced digitization, the ability to manage operations remotely and gain better insight through the data generated by systems has provided greater value. It has been nothing short of transformative for many businesses.<br><br>However, as more of their operations move online, are managed remotely, and rely on the cloud, organizations must implement robust cybersecurity strategies to safeguard the data that has proven to be so valuable to them. According to Interpol, cyber-attacks have increased significantly during the pandemic, whether through phishing, online scams, and malware such as distributed denials of service (DDoS).<br><br>As a result, organizations are becoming more aware of their data protection responsibilities under measures such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and they are looking for suppliers and partners who not only understand surveillance-related data privacy rules but can also help ensure their data is kept secure at all times.<br><br>While the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is a US-based initiative, it is still important to many European businesses. Concerns about national security are spreading beyond the United States, and governments across Europe are hardening their stance.<br><br>As a result, manufacturers vying for certain types of contracts, particularly those in the government sector or involving international trade, will need to enforce compliance across their operations and product lines if they hope to win new business opportunities.</li></ol>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Technology integration is expected to continue.</strong><br>Network technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) are already widely used, but they will continue to disrupt the security camera market by enabling new advances in HD video streaming, including on mobile devices.<br><br>In an increasingly connected world, these technologies will broaden the potential applications for audio and video analytics and AI. On a broader scale, there is a massive increase in widespread digital transformation, with key technologies driving this change including IoT and networks, as well as cloud computing, intelligent data, and AI.<br><br>The Internet of Things is expected to benefit from advancements in network technology, particularly in terms of bandwidth and latency. Including advanced network technology in cameras allows for remote real-time video surveillance, expanded use of mobile applications, and legacy network management.<br><br>Artificial intelligence Internet of Things (IoT) can enable a nearly limitless range of potential opportunities, ranging from open and integrated systems/platforms to increased device connectivity.</li></ol>



<p><strong>F</strong><strong>inally</strong></p>



<p>In short, 2022 will see the continued development of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) to provide greater value to users, creating new business opportunities for installers and integrators. And, as AI is increasingly used at the edge – on camera – its benefits will reach a much broader audience, transforming the security market.</p>



<p>More businesses will use artificial intelligence in the near future as they become more reliant on AI systems. Given these trends, it is safe to say that AI is quickly becoming a critical function for all businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CCTV Security Systems, With the evolution of science and technology, two things are evolving simultaneously. Two things that are seemingly unrelated are actually connected by the advancement of technology. If you think about it, our lifestyle has changed dramatically thanks to the onset of new technologies and concepts. At the same time, this has also led to the dynamic increase of the number of crimes. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.adiance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CCTV-Security-1024x576.png" alt="CCTV Security" class="wp-image-6080" srcset="https://www.adiance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CCTV-Security-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.adiance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CCTV-Security-300x169.png 300w, https://www.adiance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CCTV-Security-768x432.png 768w, https://www.adiance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CCTV-Security-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.adiance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CCTV-Security.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Crimes that are new, more creative and super-detailed. Statistics reveal that close to 1.3mn crimes were committed in the US alone until recent 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s like criminals spend meticulous amounts of time cracking the best plots, exploiting any minute vulnerability they could uncover. As their skills keep increasing, what should also automatically increase is our security measures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year witnessed several new forms of crimes that were unheard of before. With another year right in the corner, we firmly believe these new forms of crimes would continue to increase in numbers. That’s why the need for airtight CCTV security systems and surveillance equipment is more crucial than ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re still wondering what a proper CCTV system would save you from, here’s an extensive list.&nbsp;</p>



<h1>Crimes And Incidents Your CCTV Security Systems Would Save You From In 2022</h1>



<h2>1. Vandalism</h2>



<p>Vandalism has been casually referred to as harmless pranks for a really long time. However, in reality, these are violent acts that involve damage to property and people. Outrage and cancel culture have taken serious shape over the last few years thanks to the rise of social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has given people access to real-time information and mediums to gather crowds for propaganda and showcase collective outrage. There have been incidents of vandalising statues, organizations, office spaces, restaurants, public spaces and more. For the uninitiated, episodes like deflating vehicle tires on purpose or even marking over boards are considered acts of vandalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To keep such incidents from cropping up or to detect and punish people indulging in vandalism, advanced CCTV security systems have to be made mandatory. These devices are powered by AI (Artificial Intelligence), deep learning and machine learning and can immediately trigger an alarm for law enforcement agents to rush in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are also equipped with facial recognition features that will help officials track down criminals involved in such acts.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>2. Package Thieves</h2>



<p>As bizarre as it may sound, package theft is one of the most common crimes in the US. Statistics reveal that around 1.7mn packages are either lost or stolen every single day in the US.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, you read it right &#8211; every single day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has been one of the more recent forms of crime stemming from the rise of eCommerce and zero contact delivery protocols. Professional package thieves lurk around areas or even track delivery vehicles and strike once the packages are delivered. They target houses or deliveries that are not handed over to people but placed outside for collection. They also strike between the time an agent delivers a package and the user comes to collect it from the porsche or mailbox.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The concept of package theft is expensive as well. It causes a cumulative loss of around $25mn to companies. While businesses like Amazon have introduced secure lockers for users, there is definitely space for you to upgrade your measures and install solid CCTV security systems in your premises.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will allow you to not only deter crimes but help in tracking package thieves and reporting crimes to the police. The most ideal types of cameras you could include to prevent package theft is an ANPR camera that tracks number plates of vehicles and WiFi cameras that streams high definition footage in real time to your monitors and secondary devices such as smartphones and tablets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With these two solutions, you can ensure security and peace of mind at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>3. Shoplifting</h2>



<p>There are over 27 million shoplifters in the US devoid of any profiles. To throw in some numbers, over 200 million cases are registered annually. If the numbers were refined, you would have close to 550,000 shoplifting cases every day and around 23,000 cases every single hour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even professionals of criminal justice agree that shoplifting is not a petty crime but a gateway to more serious and violent crimes. If you own a retail store or a chain of it, the first step you implement is a CCTV camera in your store premises.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will help you deter shoplifting crimes as shoplifters tend to remain low when they know they are being watched. Apart from this, you could also keep an eye out on your employees working on your cash register and simultaneously prevent incidents like break-ins and burglaries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adiance has the perfect range of Edge AI cameras you could deploy across all your aisles and eliminate shoplifting instances. There are also bullet cameras that conveniently record and stream HD footage to your security team in stealth. These devices are devoid of cables and connect to your wireless networks. Some models even come with cellular connectivity for more portable deployment. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Apart from these, other new-age crimes and incidents include stalking, asset theft in organizations and workplaces, office space harassment, false accusations of crimes and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you deploy CCTV security systems, you help prevent crimes but more importantly collect airtight evidence to uphold justice. Cases like false accusations are increasing and adequate proof and measures can help the innocent get justice and perpetrators get punished.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deploying a security solution is more than fundamental these days and going forward, its importance will only increase. So, if you’re looking for solid security solutions for your diverse needs, get in touch with us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Computer vision is a game-changer in the IT sector. We have put to the use the best possible benefits of computer vision to our advantage through our extensive R&amp;D and testing. Our superior cameras are now equipped with powerful AI and machine learning algorithms that let you track and automatically identify suspicious objects, entities or people in a crowd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through intense data training and reinforcement learning, we have developed our solutions to be as airtight as possible in terms of detecting anomalies. So, even in a perfectly seeming environment, our cameras can pick up the most minute of details that could trigger a hazardous event. This keeps your offices, organizations and enterprises safe and secured at all times.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>5. AI-powered Panorama</h2>



<p>Our analytics database revealed that a lot of organizations wanted to cover a wider field in their premises with a single camera. While conventional cameras did a commendable job, data showed us the space for new innovation. That’s when we ventured into developing AI-powered panoramic cameras that featured fish-eye lenses instead of conventional ones for a wider field of view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of the reason that fish-eye lenses are also delicate, we also ensured the casings underwent an overhaul in terms of strength and durability to resist, wear and tear or damage. The result is the ultra-solid AI-powered panoramic camera that does more than what you expect out of it.&nbsp;</p>

<h1 class="has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size"><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Exclusive Benefits of Customized CCTV Surveillance Cameras</span></h1>



<p>Families are developing their own customized smart houses, which are properties that are fitted with security Surveillance Cameras, home automation, and round-the-clock surveillance, in our technological era. Technology advancements have resulted in a rise in the number of cameras that can be modified to meet specific needs.</p>



<p>CCTV surveillance cameras are complicated, and there may not be a pre-packaged kit that meets your specific requirements. When this happens, you&#8217;ll need a fully customized security surveillance system that&#8217;s matched to your needs. Smart customized surveillance cameras that use IP technology, edge analytics, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity will offer up new horizons and opportunities in a variety of industries. Here are some of the primary advantages that implementing a CCTV surveillance camera that is specially created for the specific demands of your property and its location may provide for your house or business:</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size"><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">1.Connecting to Smart Home Systems</span></h2>



<p>If you want a security system that supports your operations and provides efficiency, you&#8217;ll need an integrated security system. Integrating security equipment is important to developing a great system, therefore any security installer worth their salt should be well-versed in it. Smart home security systems and <a href="https://www.adiance.com/4g-camera/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Custom-built CCTV surveillance cameras</span></strong></a> frequently work well together. Security cameras, for example, when combined with remote door release technology, allow you to see who is at the door before selecting whether or not to let them in with the touch of a button.</p>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size">2. <span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Surveillance using the Internet</span></h2>



<p>You can choose options like remote monitoring with custom security solutions. This would enable you to keep an eye on your home without having to be present. It allows you to see live video surveillance from your security cameras on your smartphone, tablet, or computer from anywhere. You&#8217;ll be able to keep an eye on your property, employees, and operations from anywhere with an internet connection.</p>
</div></div>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size">3. Self-Assurance in Your Safety</h2>



<p>If you have a pre-packaged system or are utilizing an outdated security system, you most likely have security concerns that you push to the back of your mind to save money. When you are the victim of a crime and your security fails, the consequences can be devastating. As a result, a bare-bones approach to surveillance can be costly in the event of a break-in, vandalism, or other criminal activity. Fortunately, CCTV surveillance cameras are affordable and can give critical video coverage of the people, places, and things you can&#8217;t afford to lose.</p>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size">4. Installation That is Undetectable</h2>



<p>Don&#8217;t make your lovely home unpleasant and unattractive by putting enormous surveillance cameras and cords everywhere. Not only is it unsightly, but it also demonstrates to a burglar where cameras are located and how to easily remove them so that they can just snip a cord and enter the house without being detected. A tailored CCTV surveillance camera is simple to install since cords are hidden, cameras are compact, and they are strategically placed to provide maximum surveillance while being unnoticeable. The beauty of your home as well as the surveillance and security capabilities of your system benefit from a discreet installation.</p>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size">5. Experts on Hand to Assist</h2>



<p>Many traditional CCTV sales representatives are solely educated to market their organization&#8217;s equipment, not to assess the unique demands of your residence and location. Most of the time, they will cut corners and lower the price to give you a pre-packaged package that does little to deter or prevent criminal behavior. When you choose a customized security solution, you&#8217;ll often have access to security professionals 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Having your facilities inspected by a security specialist who is concerned about your demands and wants to safeguard your company will considerably improve your company&#8217;s security. They&#8217;ll make a plan rather than a pre-packaged solution, and they&#8217;ll back it up with strong reasoning. This kind of experience is rarely found in packaged solutions.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h1 class="has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size">Conclusion</h1>



<p>A personalized CCTV surveillance camera is an excellent investment for your peace of mind and that of your family. Pre-packaged security camera systems sold in large box retailers simply do not fulfill the demands of real-world surveillance applications, which necessitate specialized security systems with several camera kinds. Without the burden of being a tech guru, you can easily design a top-notch security camera system with customizable cameras. Designing and establishing a personal CCTV surveillance system simplifies security viewing and management, delivering everything you&#8217;ll need for your exclusive security monitoring.</p>
