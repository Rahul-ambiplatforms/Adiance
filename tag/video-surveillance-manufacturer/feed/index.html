<h2>What Makes Adiance a Truly Unique Video Surveillance Manufacturer Industry Player?</h2>



<p>Every business or home has a specific requirement when it comes to video surveillance. We provide a comprehensive range of products with numerous benefits catering to the unique needs of customers.</p>



<h3>1. Product Range</h3>



<p>Our wide-ranging product list – from 4G cameras to thermal cameras, from Edge AI camera to ANPR surveillance system – is second to none. The Edge AI-based bullet camera comes with many unique features such as ANPR detection, facial recognition, and object detection giving homes and businesses complete peace of mind.</p>



<p>The 3G/4G <strong><a href="https://www.vmukti.com/products/ambicam-4g-camera/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.vmukti.com/products/ambicam-4g-camera/"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Cloud CCTV camera</span></a><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"> </span></strong>system comes to aid homes and factories in locations with limited or no WiFi connectivity. This camera system comes equipped with a SIM card slot and operates on 4G or 3G networks. Wouldn’t you say it is perfect for both outdoor and remote locations?</p>



<p>The Edge Dome bullet Camera is another high-tech offering from Adiance. This camera offers cloud monitoring options, FHD streams for a more refined definition of images, remote monitoring capability, and live stream access to your preferred device from any location in the world.</p>



<p>Our products are suited for your homes, small apartment complexes, and monitoring of large junctions and cities.</p>



<h3>2. Research and Innovation</h3>



<p>Adiance brings to you the latest in video capturing technology by focusing consistently on research and development. We build products on the latest innovative technology. We sincerely believe that it is one of the reasons why our products and services are sought after by diverse customer groups. Since serving this segment, we build on our experience and provide impeccable expert advice and service to our clients. </p>



<h3>3. High-end Technology</h3>



<p>Our technical prowess and extensive knowledge give us the competitive advantage required for manufacturing good products. For example, the Adiance 4K UHD camera is designed so that it uses deep-learning technology and is capable of separating human beings from objects/vehicles even from massive amounts of video data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, this surveillance system also stores snapshots of objects that can come in handy when reviewing the video footage for any specific purpose. This advanced algorithm-based camera is most suitable for larger businesses and factories. When we mean high technology, we mean it.</p>



<h3>4. Feature-rich Products at Affordable Prices</h3>



<p>All our products are feature-rich, and they come at affordable prices, offering you value and functionality. The core strength of Adiance lies in bringing several preferred benefits into our surveillance solutions. Our quality products match the best in the world since we make sure high-quality is inbuilt in our products and services at every step of the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We offer a cloud storage facility, so you don’t have to worry about a shortage of storage space on your surveillance system. Moreover, the remote monitoring capability of our cameras comes in handy when you have to keep an eye on your home or office, even in your absence. The digital zoom technology is beneficial in focusing on faces and objects. The ANPR solution is the absolute go-to technology for businesses and large residential complexes when they have to instantly look at the number plates of vehicles entering and exiting their premises.</p>



<p>We provide additional features such as motion detection, facial detection, night-vision, and 4X zoom because of our products’ higher-end software technology.</p>



<h3>5. Entirely Customized to Specific Needs</h3>



<p>Each customer has a specific need for video surveillance systems. If you are a homeowner, you’ll have unique requirements based on the size of your home and your surveillance needs. These requirements of a homeowner will not be the same as that of a person running a business, and the needs and purposes of a security system are different. That’s the reason why we offer an extensive range of products and services that suit the diverse needs of businesses.</p>



<h3>6. Support and Service</h3>



<p>We understand that it is not enough to deliver a high-end video surveillance system, and it is equally essential to provide exceptional and timely support services to clients. We have skilled engineers and service technicians who offer round-the-clock support to our customers. Moreover, we also offer a range of preventive maintenance solutions for our esteemed clients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While technical support is an integral part of our offering, we ensure you have all the tools necessary to use the security system independently. Of course, we offer technical support at every step of the way so that you gain the maximum efficiency of the system.</p>
