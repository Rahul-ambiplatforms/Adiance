<p>Automatic Number Plate Recognition (Customized ANPR Cameras), introduced in the UK in the 1980s, has been a standard in traffic management. It is a high-speed image capture technology that identifies number plates as they pass through an infrared camera.</p>



<p>Initially, ANPR was used primarily by police officers to detect and thwart criminal activities. They allow police to monitor traffic and look out for suspect cars by placing cameras at highly suspected areas.</p>



<p>With time, the use of these cameras expanded to other areas, and today they&#8217;re installed in spaces like retail parks, supermarkets, private car parks, etc. Many car parks have ANPR parking systems that monitor how long a vehicle has been parked. They can also check if the parking fees were paid.</p>



<p>With the increasing demand for an efficient security surveillance system in many spaces, the market size for ANPR systems is expected to grow from USD 2.3 billion in 2020 to USD 3.8 billion by 2025, with a CAGR of 10% over the forecast period.</p>



<h2>What is ANPR Camera? How does it Work?</h2>



<p>ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) is a camera that uses optical character recognition and reads vehicle number plates when they approach. Here’s how it works:</p>



<ol><li>The ANPR camera takes an image of a vehicle number plate.</li><li>The image is passed on to a reader that converts number plates into standard Wiegand format ID numbers.</li><li>The number plate is compared with existing database records, and the access control system then analyzes this data to decide whether or not to grant access to the vehicle.</li><li>If the vehicle is to be granted access, the controller will send a signal to the gate/barrier to open.<br><br>ANPR is used to read license plates and identify cars, buses, trucks, and motorbikes. It’s also regarded as LPR or License Plate Reader.<br></li></ol>



<h2>5 Benefits of Customized ANPR Cameras</h2>



<p>The use of <strong><a href="https://www.adiance.com/anpr-camera/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">customized ANPR cameras</span></a></strong> has gone upwards throughout history, and that&#8217;s down to the numerous advantages they offer. Let&#8217;s see why ANPR cameras have become an important part of modern-day vehicle surveillance systems.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Completely Automated</strong><br>Although a security gate or barrier system can help deter crime and protect your property from intruders, it can also be time-consuming and manual. Vehicles will automatically be granted access to sites if there is an ANPR system. The system can match the vehicle&#8217;s number plate onto the main system. Fully automated ANPR camera system systems do not require employees to operate them.<br></li><li><strong>Better Security</strong><br>Automated customized ANPR systems work on the latest technologies and yield 99% accuracy in spotting unauthorized vehicles entering the premises. Thus, they unquestionably provide greater security and accuracy than manual checks, which are vulnerable to human errors.<br>ANPR systems provide you with peace of mind as they&#8217;re highly reliable at identifying safety issues, detecting a speeding driver, and helping to address them before a serious accident occurs.<br></li><li><strong>Time-Saving &amp; Efficient</strong><br>Automated ANPR systems manage access control and align with barriers and gates. This can help reduce time and improve management. The tracking of vehicle number plates can help you monitor employee clock-ins and clock-outs, eliminating the need for a dedicated person for the job.<br></li><li><strong>24/7 System</strong><br>As ANPR systems can operate 24 hours a day, they reduce or eliminate the need for security patrols and manned guarding. Moreover, it eases overall management.<br></li><li><strong>Real-Time Tracking</strong><br>ANPR is advantageous to numerous industries because of the real-time images it provides. In the past, number plate recording was time-consuming, and it took even more time to send out penalty notices to those who break traffic laws.<br>With ANPR, however, the number plates can be identified and checked against the database in a matter of minutes. Based on this, it can take less than 48 hours to issue a penalty notice. These cameras are fast and can respond quickly to crimes, thus ensuring that any undesirable behavior is not allowed to go unchecked.</li></ol>



<h3><strong>Final Words</strong></h3>



<p>The importance of a customized ANPR camera cannot be understated. It is one of the most important components in a transport surveillance solution. The idea of a customized ANPR camera is to create a system for capturing and recognizing license plates from various distances, under various lighting conditions, and even in adverse weather conditions.</p>
