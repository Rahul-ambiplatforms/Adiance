The use of artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge, particularly analytics based on deep learning algorithms, will be a critical component in a variety of &#8220;smart surveillance&#8221; applications.<br><br>These include object detecting, as well as the collection of attributes as metadata â€“ all while lowering latency and system bandwidth requirements and allowing for real-time data gathering and situational monitoring.<br><br>AI and edge computing will continue to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of network video surveillance systems by using analytics to supervise any kind of area or situation (for example, object, loitering, virtual line, and area crossing detection). With AI and edge computing enabled by cameras used across vertical sectors, users can conduct &#8216;pre-emptive detection&#8217; and rely less on reactive monitoring, increasing safety and efficiency.</li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>AI Network is integrating vision-based surveillance systems.</strong><br>Video surveillance systems are evolving from basic monitoring devices to comprehensive solutions that can be used in any vertical industry or market sector.<br><br>The driving force behind this is the incorporation of AI technology at all levels of systems, a trend that is expected to accelerate at an unprecedented rate. Indeed, according to industry analysts, the global AI-based surveillance and security market will be worth $4.46 billion by 2023.<br><br>Artificial intelligence, with its two most popular components, machine learning, and deep learning, is already propelling innovation by improving data and business intelligence. We have made significant progress in diversifying metadata, improving accuracy, and increasing granularity, which will allow surveillance systems to provide better security.<br><br>AI vision solutions that use AI cameras as vision sensors generate meaningful business intelligence that can help organizations better understand their customers and operations. Thermal imaging and body temperature detection cameras installed at public entrances and lobby areas employ edge-based AI algorithms to avoid non-human heat sources and reduce false alarms.<br><br>People-counting algorithms are used in cloud-based solutions to assist store owners in evaluating sales or floor design strategies, as well as heat-mapping to measure and avoid long checkout lines to increase customer satisfaction. Traffic management and smart parking systems, logistics and distribution, and critical area monitoring in healthcare all have similar applications and benefits. Businesses can automate their security measures so that the appropriate response is pre-planned and ready to go.<br></li><li><strong>Business model rise</strong><br>&#8216;Video Surveillance as a Service,&#8217; &#8216;Access Control as a Service,&#8217; and other similar phrases are becoming more common in the security industry. What exactly does &#8220;as a service&#8221; mean, and what are the advantages that come with it?<br>As cloud-based services evolve and mature, video surveillance manufacturers can now offer &#8216;Solution as a Service.&#8217; Video surveillance system installers and integrators can now provide solutions to their customers through cloud-based platforms and then implement this model throughout all areas of their business.<br><br>The global market for public cloud application services is expected to reach billions of dollars by 2022. By combining applications, infrastructure, and business processes into a single &#8216;as a service,&#8217; or &#8216;aaS&#8217; offering, businesses can reap numerous benefits.<br><br>They can respond quickly to rapidly changing market conditions, bring new products and services to market more quickly, and maximize the benefits of advanced analytics to improve operations through meaningful insights â€“ all of which contribute to a distinct competitive advantage.<br><br>Organizations can use these models to tailor solutions to their specific needs rather than relying on off-the-shelf offerings. A SaaS approach can provide scalability and cost-effectiveness by providing services through an operating expenditure framework, with services delivered via subscription, reducing capital expenditure.<br><br>&#8216;VSaaS&#8217; could provide cloud-based video surveillance by implementing SaaS concepts to video surveillance, eliminating the need for on-premises servers and allowing organizations to rapidly deploy systems without having to configure complex networks.
